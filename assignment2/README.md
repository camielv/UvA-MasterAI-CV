Setup
=====

For this assignment we are required to download and compile the VLFeat library to:
- Find Interest Points
- Match Interest Points

The repository is automatically cloned by the included Makefile, but we require
that you build it manually because the building process depends on your MATLAB
installation folder.

The VLFeat repository should be compiled via:

    make MEX=/MATLABdir/bin/mex
